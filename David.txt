Pereira, Colombia

To the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies:

“I come as one but I stand as ten thousand”, those are the immortal words written by the activist, professor, and poet Maya Angelou (where). This letter is the collective effort of relatives, friends, acquaintances, mentors, and lovers alike who have supported me across more than 40,000 kilometres (around the globe).

My upbringing in a country with a remarkable diversity that has also been suffering from deep corruption and systemic war, from drug cartels to paramilitary groups. This environment had also an effect on my parents, who would often return from work with aching bodies, trying their best to provide for my brother and me. With their actions, they ensured that I learnt discipline, moral principles and the importance of education.

The school I attended was a predominantly white, bilingual and characterised by a welcoming charm, where I had my first chance to look outside of my “bubble” through the international faculty. Then through my social studies classes, where MUN simulations were organized, events that laid a seed of interest for international affairs. My bachelors in Industrial Engineering was not selected because of vocation or passion, nonetheless, it allowed me to understand sets of data to deliver the best path of improvement for any given process. 

I started to forge my future for the first time when I looked for a part-time job at the same time I was starting university. Responsibility was my main take away. One year later I wanted to focus on something more meaningful, so I joined the team of environmental interpreters that the botanical garden of my university had. Understanding the key principles of sustainability, collective responsibility, social-nature balance and climate change. Even in the last month, I have taken my formal education forward, investing my savings on a series of online courses about international conflict and international law, learning about the different pressing issues, the treaties that go in hand with them, how they are enforced and by which bodies.

Joining AIESEC, an international NGO in my third year of university, pushed me to look closer at my personal and professional life. Over the years in the organization, I supported the implementation and engagement of third parties while also spreading awareness about the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Initially, as a volunteer, later as part of national executive boards across the Americas, Asia, Europe and Africa, I created and implemented international strategies. 

After leaving Colombia, I was exposed to almost every nationality on earth, having the privilege of living in different countries and attending numerous conferences. Learning first hand about different global issues, their ramifications and how they affect everyday citizens. Among them: The Sudanese and Syrian war, the Crimea dispute, the USA intervention in the Middle East, Baltics and Latin America, the contrast between the eastern and western Europe post WW2 and the Palestine/Middle East-Israeli conflict. This shaped my understanding of the daily geopolitical state around the world, allowing me to study the world I wish to improve. 

The reason for my application goes deeper than that: As a member of the LGBT+ community, I am always on the look for encouraging stories and how countries are adapting to different policies. And even though our attitude of gay people has greatly improved in recent years, I still see so much inequality und suffering in our community. So I forged a vision: Improve how the world perceives the LGBT+ community.

More than three years ago I was shown the Graduate Institute by one of the alumni and after he saw my potential, passion, and ambition, he mentioned that your institution might be a catalyst for my vision. After a deep research, I believe the MIA program with its interdisciplinary approach, combining both a strong academic and practical methodology, can offer me the insights needed to solve tomorrow’s problems in the LGBT+ community. Additionally, with its unique research practice of the Capstone projects, I hope to conduct meaningful research that leads to change and builds for tomorrow. Given that I want to join an organization with a global scope after graduating, the tools that both the University and Geneva - as the heart of international diplomacy - can provide, are incomparable. That’s why I been forming and reiterating myself over the years to be part of your institution. 

I am writing as an engineer, volunteer, scholar, queer, Latino, traveller and dreamer. I want to finish my letter with the sentence I will be thinking on my graduation day of the Master in International Affairs: “I got this far because of the path so many have paved for me, now I shall keep paving the way for many others”.

Sincerely,
David Calle Garcia
