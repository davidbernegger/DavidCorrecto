Pereira, Colombia

To: The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies

Privilege, the word that can best define my early education in life. I had the honour to study in one of the best schools of my city. A bilingual, white-dominated and welcoming space. From all the family members that were enlisted to this school only a quarter of us manage to graduate from it. 

Why? When I was younger the school fee was an affordable option for a lower middle class family in Pereira. As the school was slowly growing from a small house in the city to a country side mega project the fee elevated, leaving no choice for many but to drop out. 

As for me, given that my school holds a yearly art exposition were all its students create a painting, sculpture or installation this matched with my parent’s occupation, as created the canvases for the paintings, the frames that would held the art pieces, the bases for the sculptures or wood-made pieces related to the installations. That’s how my parents would afford my school. Under that agreement I had the chance to access an international faculty, intensive (7am to 4pm) and excellent education. Additionally, the unique chance to learn a second language (something that is still exceptional in my country), this later would prove to be the key to unlock my international experiences.

Looking back at those years I can hardly believe the effort my parents did and that they are still making to this day so me and my brother have the best conditions, they would often come with aching bodies after weeks of non stop work (even weekends). With their daily actions they ensured that I understood the importance of discipline, moral principles and education. 

I chose my university not because of passion or vocation but because it was the only public university in my city, therefore the only option. 

At the time I was starting university I decided to set a personal goal, knowing my country better by traveling to a different city every year. I picked a newspaper, a red pen and selected a weekend job so it would not clash with my classes. A few days after starting university classes I also started as party recreationist, sharing with children and adults, it was a very joyful job that lasted for 3 years (2012-2015), learning about dedication and responsibility.

My second year of university I started a new job, because of what it could teach me and the new opportunities it could bring, hence I presented my CV and after a month of trials and rigorous natural science education, I became an environmental interpreter in the botanical garden of my university. A job I had until I left the country after finishing all my subjects from my bachelors. After 4 years (2013-2017) of constant improvement in the field I had the opportunity to understand and create awareness to hundreds about the key principles of sustainability, collective responsibility, social-nature balance and climate change.

Even though my education was challenging, it was not fulfilling. Given this, on my third year of university I decided to join an international NGO which triggered a series of events that pushed me to look closer into two aspects; my personal and professional life. Allowing me to define who I am and what I want. After being a volunteer for 3 years (2014-2017), scaling in the internal hierarchical ladder and after finishing all my subjects I took a critical jump and became part of the national board of Panama (2017-18), Jordan (2018-19) and Austria (2019-20). 

By experiencing different countries and being part of international conferences, I was permitted to share with people from almost every country on earth. Learning first hand about different global issues, their ramifications and the main actors. As a member of the LGBT+ community, I was always on the look for encouraging stories and the different policies that countries were adapting, finding mainly tragedy. So I forged a vision: Improve how the world perceives the LGBT+ community.

After years of discovering myself and the world, for the first time I am completely sure about my next step: Studying the Master in International Affairs at the Graduate Institute, as a program and institution that I know form the stories I heard from its alumni, can serve me as a catalyst for my goals. 

I will portray only excellence in the institution, but that can only continue if I’m granted this support as my parents nor myself have enough savings to support both the tuition fee and the expenses of living in Geneva. Today I ask you to look at my story, the struggles that I and every individual that have supported me has gone though and my very unique journey to see the potential, passion, ambition and determination that I carry to achieve my dreams.

Sincerely,

David Calle Garcia
